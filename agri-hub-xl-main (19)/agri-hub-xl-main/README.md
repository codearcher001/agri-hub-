## Features

### 🌱 Crop Disease Analysis
- **Crop Identification**: Automatically identifies crop types from images
- **Disease Detection**: Detects diseases with confidence scoring
- **Severity Assessment**: Low/Medium/High/Critical severity levels
- **Treatment Recommendations**: Specific treatment plans and dosages
- **Yield Loss Estimation**: Percentage-based yield impact assessment

### 📊 Comprehensive Reporting
- **Detailed Reports**: Includes crop name, disease, symptoms, causes, treatments
- **Financial Impact**: Cost estimates for treatment and yield loss projections
- **Multiple Formats**: Text and JSON report downloads
- **Professional Formatting**: Structured, easy-to-read reports

### 🔧 API Integration
- **Plant.id API**: Production-grade plant and disease identification
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Complete API for upload, analysis, and reporting
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple images simultaneously
- **Fallback System**: Basic analysis if AI API fails

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

**Option 1: Use the setup script (recommended)**
```bash
./setup-env.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual setup**
Copy the example environment file and configure your API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

The API key is already configured in the example file:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLANT_ID_API_KEY=your_plant_id_key_here
PLANT_ID_API_KEY=your_plant_id_key_here
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Test the System

Visit the test pages to verify functionality:
- `/test-upload` - Basic file upload testing
  

## API Endpoints

### Upload and Analysis
- `POST /api/photos/upload` - Upload image with automatic analysis
- `POST /api/photos/analyze` - Analyze existing or new images
- `GET /api/photos/analyze` - Get analysis history

## How It Works

1. Upload crop images through the web interface or API
2. Plant.id analyzes the image for diseases and health issues
3. System generates comprehensive reports with treatment recommendations
4. Download detailed reports in multiple formats
5. Track analysis history and monitor crop health over time
